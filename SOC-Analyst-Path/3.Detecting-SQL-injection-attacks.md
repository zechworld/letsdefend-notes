# What is SQL Injection (SQLi)?
These type of attacks are critical due to the type of information that can be leaked. These attacks occur in web applications that include unsanitized access to the data using SQL queries. Nowadays, frameworks used to develop web apps have preventive mechanisms to avoid the leakage of data through SQL injections. Nonetheless, some updates can lead to a possible SQL Injection, and more often than not, the user might not be using the framework properly, thus backing up the fact of the user being the weakest link in the chain.

## Types of SQL injections
- **In-band SQLi (Classic SQLi)**: The process of injection and the retrival of results occurs on the same channel of communication.
- **Inferential SQLi (Blind SQLi)**: Queries that receive a response but cannot be seen are called this way. 
- **Out-of-band SQLi**: The response to a SQL query is communicated through another channel. For example, if an attacker receives replies to a SQL query via DNS.

# How does SQL Injection work?
Web applications are built so there can be some type of communication between the user and a web server. This interchange of information is made through user input, allowing them to retrieve data and displaying specific content. This communication process is the cornerstone of these types of attacks, exploting improper input validation and insecure query construction.

A user is expected to enter their credential data on the login page. This is translated into SQL query to retrieve data from the DB like the one below:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='USERNAME' AND password='USER_PASSWORD'`
>This query basically means "Bring the information of certain username from the users table with the USERNAME and USER_PASSWORD". If the credentials create a match, then the user will be authenticated, otherwise, if there's no user with those credentials in the DB, the login will fail.

Now, lets assume that these inputs don't have any validation, of course if we type the correct format the system will continue to run without errors (authenticating users or failing to log in). But, what if we change the format of one of the inputs to create a `SQL Syntax Error`.

Lets assume our username is "einar" and the password is "bjorn". The same query than before will work:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='einar' AND password='bjorn'`
