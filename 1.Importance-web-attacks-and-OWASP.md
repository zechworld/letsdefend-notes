# What are web attacks?

A web application is an application that provides some kind of services through Internet using a browser interface. This applications make up a large parte of the Internet usage today (e.g. Google, Facebook, YouTube, etc). This acts as an interface between the user's machine and the Internet, which makes it vulnerable for exploits, and as consequence, attackers can gain access to devices and all sorts of personal data or organizational data.

## Web Application Defined
The Web is a highly programmable environment that allows mass customization through the deployment of a large and diverse range of applications to millions of global users. Modern websites are constructed from **"Web Browser"** and **"Web Application"**.

- Web Browser is a software that allows users to retrieve data and interact with content located within a website.Through this, websites allow the *capture, processing, storage and transmission* of sensitive customer data for immediate and recurrent use, all of this is done through *web applications*.

- Web Applications are computer programs allowing website visitors to submit and retrieve data to/from a database over the Internet. This data is presented to the user within their browser as information generated dynamically by the web application. 


Some of the attacks methods used to infiltrate web applications are:
- SQL Injection
- Cross Site Scripting
- Command Injection
- IDOR
- RFI & LFI
- File Upload (Web Shell)

## Why Detecting Web Attacks 
Web applications are consider as gateways for attackers, mainly because these apps contain critical data. Organizations have multiple web application that are highly complex and have numerous attack vectors, making it difficult to control. Around 75% of cyber attacks are done through web apps, this is why we need to have strong security measures that aim at preventing and detecting threats that exploit Web Apps (WAF, IPS, SIEM rules).

## OWASP

A = Application
S = Security
P = Project

Non profit foundation dedicated to improving software security. It publishes a list of the 10 web app vulnerabilities that post the most critical security risks. The 2021 list was as follows:

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfig
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10. Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
